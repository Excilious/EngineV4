An engine which has rewrites to most parts. Based upon EngineV3 and EngineV2 with some parts of the code remained. Collision systems may not work and are currently debugged by rendering a vector 
mesh that contains all the vectors needed for the collision system (essentially a collision mesh). Objects are not properly coded in. There are unique file formats that aim to keep all 
resources within one file.
